A Trash-finder App

The rise in population is corresponding to the increase of consumption which in turn affects the volume of garbage in Denpasar City. In 2019, the amount of garbage produced per day is up to 969,231 tons. As the human population grows, so does the amount of garbage, and if we do not solve this problem, we might see a future where lands and seas are filled with garbage. From this, we can see the urgency to solve the garbage problem in our society.
Based on this goal, it is important to change the mindset of people who still collect garbage and dispose of it without thinking about the environment. People should be more mindful of the environment and learn how to reduce and handle waste properly. The waste reduction includes 3R activities, namely reuse, reduce, and recycle, while waste handling activities include sorting, collecting, transporting, and final processing. 
The implementation of 3R in our daily life, reduce and reuse is usually simpler to do and requires minimal knowledge and effort. However, recycling is considerably more complicated and difficult. Many people lack the knowledge and time to implement recycling as part of their life. To address this problem, we want to create a solution using an app called Trashflow where people who own garbage are able to discover individuals or groups that are looking to buy garbage either to recycle it or to repurpose it into other items and vice versa.
